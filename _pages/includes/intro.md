I am a fourth-year B.Sc. student in the [Research Center for Social Computing and Interactive Robotics (SCIR)](http://ir.hit.edu.cn/) at **Harbin Institute of Technology** (HIT, China), currently interning at **Shanghai Innovation Institute**. 

I am broadly interested in **Natural Language Processing** and **Machine Learning**. My current research focuses on **Reinforcement Learning**, **Self-Evolving Agent** and **Synthetic Data Generation**. I am particularly interested in leveraging reinforcement learning and its derivative techniques to stimulate the self-evolving capabilities of LLM-based agents in real-world environments.

If you are interested in any form of academic collaboration, please feel free to email me at [mzli@ir.hit.edu.cn](mailto:mzli@ir.hit.edu.cn).
