I am a prospective Ph.D. student (starting Fall 2026) jointly at the College of Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence, Fudan University, and the Shanghai Innovation Institute, advised by [Prof. Xipeng Qiu](https://xpqiu.github.io/). Currently, I am a senior undergraduate student at Harbin Institute of Technology. 

I am broadly interested in **Natural Language Processing** and **Machine Learning**. My current research focuses on **Reinforcement Learning**, **Self-Evolving Agent** and **Synthetic Data Generation**. I am particularly interested in leveraging reinforcement learning and its derivative techniques to stimulate the self-evolving capabilities of LLM-based agents in real-world environments.

If you are interested in any form of academic collaboration, please feel free to email me at [mzli@ir.hit.edu.cn](mailto:mzli@ir.hit.edu.cn).
