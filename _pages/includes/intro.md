I am a fourth-year B.Sc. student in the [Research Center for Social Computing and Information Retrieval (SCIR)](http://ir.hit.edu.cn/) at **Harbin Institute of Technology** (HIT, China), currently interning at **Shanghai Innovation Institute**. 

I am broadly interested in **natural language processing** and **machine learning**. My current research focuses on **synthetic data generation** and **self-improvement of large language models (LLMs)**. I am particularly interested in developing methods that can enhance the diversity and difficulty of synthesized instructions, enabling LLMs to learn more effectively from unlabeled text.

My research contributions include the development of **Self-Foveate**, an innovative LLM-driven method for instruction synthesis that uses multi-level foveation to enhance both diversity and difficulty of synthesized instructions from unsupervised text.

**我是哈尔滨工业大学社会计算与交互机器人研究中心（SCIR）的四年级本科生，目前在上海创智学院实习。**

**我的研究兴趣主要集中在自然语言处理和机器学习领域，特别是大语言模型的合成数据生成和自我改进。我致力于开发能够提高合成指令多样性和难度的方法，使大语言模型能够从无监督文本中更有效地学习。**
