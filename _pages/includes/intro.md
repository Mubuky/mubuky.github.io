I am a fourth-year B.Sc. student in the [Research Center for Social Computing and Information Retrieval (SCIR)](http://ir.hit.edu.cn/) at **Harbin Institute of Technology** (HIT, China), currently interning at **Shanghai Innovation Institute**. 

I am broadly interested in **natural language processing** and **machine learning**. My current research focuses on **synthetic data generation** and **self-improvement of large language models (LLMs)**. I am particularly interested in developing methods that can enhance the diversity and difficulty of synthesized instructions, enabling LLMs to learn more effectively from unlabeled text.

If you are interested in any form of academic collaboration, please feel free to email me at [mzli@ir.hit.edu.cn](mailto:mzli@ir.hit.edu.cn).
